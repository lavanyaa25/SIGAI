                <h4>AI Voice Control Vehicle
                </h4><br>
                <p>
                    Our prototype is a voice-controlled vehicle, also known as a Speech Controlled Automation System (SCAS). It can be remotely controlled by an Android application using Bluetooth technology. The purpose of our AI Voice Control Vehicle is to analyze human voice and respond to programmed commands. Basic commands include backward, forward, right, left, and stop.
                    The system requires accent training for the device to understand the commands issued, which are added through codes. Our goal is to make a robotic vehicle using advanced smartphone technology in a simple and cost-effective way. Currently, vehicles are manually controlled, requiring human effort for every action, such as starting and stopping, applying brakes, gear transmission, and acceleration.
                    However, the accuracy of detecting a voice command correctly is only 75%.

                <h4>Facial Emotion Recognition Based On Facial Landmarks</h4><br>
                <p>In this article, we present our work on the recognition and indication of emotions from a set of facial images. We use principal component analysis to identify the best matching face based on minimizing the Euclidean distance. Additionally, we use skin segmentation techniques to determine which pixels contribute to the face, allowing us to accurately determine the boundaries of the face.
                    To determine the corresponding emotions represented in an input stream (be it an image or a video), we use the 7 basic emotions and 68 facial landmarks provided by the dlib library. This allows us to accurately indicate the emotional state represented by the facial expressions present in the input stream.
                    Overall, our work highlights the importance of accurately identifying and indicating emotions using advanced image processing techniques, providing a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, including market studies, psychological research and human-computer interaction.</p><br>

                <h4>AI in Healthcare</h4><br>
                <p>AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and increasing efficiency. AI can help doctors diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly through medical imaging analysis. It can also analyze large amounts of patient data from EHRs to identify patterns and trends that can improve treatment decisions. AI can even help discover new drugs and treatments for diseases. Virtual health assistants powered by AI can assist patients in managing their healthcare needs, while predictive analytics can identify patients at high risk of developing diseases, allowing doctors to intervene earlier and provide better treatments. However, ethical and responsible implementation of AI is crucial to ensure patient privacy and equitable access to healthcare.</p>
